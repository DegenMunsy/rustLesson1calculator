# Rust Lesson One: Console Calculator

This rust program is designed to run a basic calculator in your console. 

## Concepts

To build this calculator I used the borrowing concept as well as string variables.
The `read_line()` method is used to borrow the `num1`, `num2`, and `operator` variables to store user input
The code uses string variables top to bottom.

## Usage

To run the program; fork the repo, open using vs code, run 'cargo run' in the terminal, follow the prompts in your terminal. 

```bash
cargo run
```

## Contributions

This calculator was built using lessons from the Ackee Blockchain Winter School of Solana, Youtube tutorials, and online assistance.
